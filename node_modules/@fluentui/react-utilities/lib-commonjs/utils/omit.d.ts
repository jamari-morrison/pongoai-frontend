/**
 * Tiny helper to do the minimal amount of work in duplicating an object but omitting some
 * props. This ends up faster than using object ...rest or reduce to filter.
 *
 * This behaves very much like filteredAssign, but does not merge many objects together,
 * uses an exclusion object map, and avoids spreads all for optimal performance.
 *
 * See perf test for background:
 * https://jsperf.com/omit-vs-rest-vs-reduce/1
 *
 * @param obj - The object to clone
 * @param exclusions - The array of keys to exclude
